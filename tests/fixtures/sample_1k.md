# Sample Test Document

This is a sample English document for testing DeepTranslator.

## Chapter 1: Introduction

The purpose of this document is to test the translation pipeline. It contains multiple paragraphs and sections to verify that the segmentation and translation work correctly.

Machine translation has come a long way in recent years. Modern neural machine translation systems can produce translations that are often indistinguishable from human translations.

### Key Features

The following features are important for quality translation:

- **Accuracy**: The translation should accurately convey the meaning of the original text
- **Fluency**: The translated text should read naturally in the target language
- **Style**: The translation should preserve the style and tone of the original

Here is some code that should not be translated:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

## Chapter 2: Technical Details

This chapter discusses some technical aspects of the translation process.

The translation model uses a transformer architecture with attention mechanisms. This allows it to capture long-range dependencies in the text.

> Important: Always review machine translations before publishing.

### Performance Metrics

Translation quality can be measured using various metrics:

1. BLEU score - measures n-gram overlap with reference translations
2. Human evaluation - subjective quality assessment by native speakers
3. Error rate - counts translation errors per segment

## Conclusion

This sample document demonstrates various Markdown features that the translator should handle correctly. The output should maintain all formatting while providing an accurate Chinese translation.
